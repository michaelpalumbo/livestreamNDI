# configuring Livesstream, NDI, Zoom.us Video

1.  run livestream studio
2. create an output, under *NDI Outputs*, set it to the (*Program*; sometimes this is *Program PC*)
3. Click *Start*>*NDI to Spout*
4. Open Zoom, join meeting
5. Click the arrow next to 'Start/Stop Video'> *Select a Camera* > *Spout Cam*

The program NDI to Spout has been unstable lately, and I'm looking for a solution exclusive of this app (Livestream<>Zoom via NDI)
